## Abstract
Have you ever needed a drill but not willing to buy one because you'll only use it once?  Introducing the Sugar app!  With Sugar you can request to borrow anything from tools to sporting goods.  Users of the app can see your request and loan it to you if they have it.  You can also browse other requests from the community.
